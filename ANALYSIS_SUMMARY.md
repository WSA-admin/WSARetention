4. **Validation**: Applied multiple confidence thresholds to ensure accuracy

## Recommendations

1. **Learn from UPEI's Success**: Investigate what factors contribute to UPEI's improving retention rate
2. **Support Holland College**: Examine why Holland College's retention rate declined and provide targeted support
3. **Continue Collège de l'Île Progress**: Build on the significant improvement shown at Collège de l'Île

### For Data Collection
1. **Improve 2024+ Coverage**: Enhance follow-up processes to capture retention data for more recent members
