# Graduate vs Student Retention Breakdown: 2023 vs 2024

*Analysis Date: January 2025*  
*Analysis Method: Using actual "Student Status" field from raw data*

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Major Discovery**: Previous analysis severely underestimated graduate numbers due to flawed calculation method. Using actual student status data reveals significant graduate populations in both years.

| Status | 2023 Count | 2023 Retention | 2024 Count | 2024 Retention | Change |
|--------|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Graduates** | 108 (29.7%) | **70.4%** | 103 (38.0%) | **70.9%** | **+0.5%** |
| **Current Students** | 256 (70.3%) | **77.7%** | 168 (62.0%) | **80.4%** | **+2.6%** |

### 🔑 **Key Finding**: Current students consistently outperform graduates by 7-9% in retention rates.

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### **1. Graduate Retention Challenge**
- **Persistent gap**: 7-9% lower retention than current students
- **Post-graduation vulnerability**: Critical intervention period identified
- **Stable but lower performance**: Graduates need targeted support

### **2. Positive Outmigration Trends**
- **Major improvement**: Both groups showing 5-6% reduction in outmigration
- **System-wide success**: WSA strategies working across both populations
- **Graduate outmigration down**: 17.6% → 11.7% (33% relative improvement)

### **3. Student Success Pattern**
- **Consistent outperformance**: Students excel in both years
- **Accelerating improvement**: +2.6% retention gain vs +0.5% for graduates
- **Lower uncertainty**: Students have clearer retention outcomes

### **4. Population Dynamics**
- **Growing graduate base**: 38% of 2024 registrations vs 30% in 2023
- **Recent graduate influx**: More people joining WSA after program completion
- **Mature member base**: Higher proportion of completed-program members

## 📋 Recommendations

### **Immediate (Graduate Support)**
1. **Post-graduation transition program** - Target the 70% who stay vs 80% students
2. **Graduate career placement** - Connect with PEI employment opportunities
3. **Alumni networking events** - Link 2024 graduates with successful 2023 graduates

### **Strategic (System Enhancement)**
1. **Pre-graduation counseling** - Prepare students for post-graduation retention
2. **Differentiated support** - Recognize graduates need different interventions
3. **Success story amplification** - Showcase graduates who stayed (70%+ each year)

### **Long-term (Outcome Optimization)**
1. **Bridge the gap** - Goal: Bring graduate retention to 80%+ like students
2. **Monitor trend continuation** - Track if student improvement continues
3. **Scale successful practices** - Apply what works for students to graduates
