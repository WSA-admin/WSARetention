# Resolving Unmatched Members Issue - WSA Retention Analysis

## 🚨 Problem Summary

**Issue**: 89 members from 2024 registrations are not matching with the retention survey data, resulting in incomplete retention analysis.

**Impact**: 
- Lower confidence in retention statistics
- Missing data for nearly 28% of 2024 registrations  
- Potential underestimation of actual retention rates

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Common reasons for poor matching rates:

### 1. **Name Variations**
- Nicknames vs. full names (Mike vs. Michael)
- Different name orders (First Last vs. Last, First)
- Middle names included/excluded
- Married name changes
- Spelling variations or typos

### 2. **Email Changes**
- Students changing from institutional to personal email
- Email providers changing (e.g., Gmail address changes)
- Typos in email addresses during registration

### 3. **Data Entry Inconsistencies**
- Different capitalization
- Extra spaces or special characters
- Abbreviated vs. full institution names

### 4. **Survey Response Issues**
- Members who registered but didn't respond to retention survey
- Members who responded under slightly different information

## ✅ Solution: Multi-Stage Approach

### Stage 1: Automated Improved Matching

Our enhanced matching algorithm includes:

1. **Exact Matching** (Current system)
   - Perfect email matches
   - Perfect name matches

2. **Partial Name Matching** (New)
   - First + Last name only (ignoring middle names)
   - Confidence threshold: 75%

3. **Phonetic Matching** (New)
   - Sound-alike names using consonant patterns
   - Handles spelling variations
   - Confidence threshold: 85%

4. **Email Username Matching** (New)
   - Compares email usernames when domains differ
   - Useful for students who changed email providers
   - Confidence threshold: 75%

5. **Nickname Detection** (New)
   - Common nickname mappings (Bill ↔ William, etc.)
   - Handles reversed name orders

### Stage 2: Manual LinkedIn Research

For remaining unmatched members:

1. **Export unmatched records** with LinkedIn-ready search names
2. **Search LinkedIn** for each person using:
   - Full name + institution
   - Name + location (PEI)
   - Name + program of study
3. **Verify identity** through profile information
4. **Determine current location** from profile/recent posts
5. **Update retention survey** with findings

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Place Your Data Files

```bash
# Ensure your CSV files are in the correct location:
data/raw/
├── Are they still in PEI? - Members Summary.csv
├── Website Memberships-Backend-2023.csv
└── Website Memberships-Backend-2024.csv
```

### Step 2: Run Improved Matching Analysis

```bash
python3 analyze_unmatched.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Analyze current matching statistics
- ✅ Apply improved matching algorithms
- ✅ Show potential matches for manual review
- ✅ Export unmatched records for LinkedIn research
- ✅ Generate comprehensive reports

### Step 3: LinkedIn Research Process

1. **Open the exported CSV file**: `manual_review/unmatched_members_2024_for_review.csv`

2. **For each unmatched member**:
   - Copy the `LinkedIn_Search_Name` 
   - Search LinkedIn: `"[Name]" PEI OR "Prince Edward Island"`
   - Alternative search: `"[Name]" [Institution]`
   - Check profile for current location

3. **Fill in the spreadsheet**:
   - `LinkedIn_URL`: Link to their profile
   - `Manual_Status`: 
     - "Still in PEI" 
     - "No longer in PEI"
     - "Inconclusive"
   - `Notes`: Location details or reasons for status
   - `Confidence_Level`: High/Medium/Low

### Step 4: Update Your Retention Survey

Add newly found members to your retention survey file with:
- Name (exactly as appears in registration)
- Email (exactly as appears in registration)  
- Status (from LinkedIn research)
- Notes (optional details)

### Step 5: Re-run Analysis

```bash
python3 analyze_unmatched.py
```

Verify that the match rate has improved.

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on analysis patterns, you should expect:

- **20-30 additional matches** from improved algorithms
- **40-50 members** requiring LinkedIn research
- **10-20 members** may remain inconclusive

**Target Goal**: Achieve 95%+ match rate (under 15 unmatched members)

## 🔧 Advanced Troubleshooting

### If Many Members Still Don't Match

1. **Check data quality**:
   ```bash
   python3 check_data_quality.py  # Run data validation
   ```

2. **Review institution naming**:
   - Are institution names consistent between files?
   - Check for abbreviations vs. full names

3. **Verify email formats**:
   - Are email domains consistent?
   - Check for bulk email changes

4. **Manual verification**:
   - Contact institution registrars
   - Cross-reference with other WSA databases

### If LinkedIn Research is Inconclusive

1. **Try alternative platforms**:
   - Facebook (check location)
   - Instagram (location tags)
   - Google search with specific terms

2. **Contact directly**:
   - Send follow-up email surveys
   - Phone contact if available

3. **Check WSA event attendance**:
   - Recent event participants likely still in PEI
   - Cross-reference with other WSA activities

## 📈 Quality Control Measures

### Before Finalizing Results

1. **Spot-check manual matches**:
   - Verify 10-20 LinkedIn findings
   - Ensure status assignments are consistent

2. **Review statistical patterns**:
   - Does retention rate align with expectations?
   - Are there unusual patterns by institution/country?

3. **Document confidence levels**:
   - Track which matches are high vs. low confidence
   - Note any assumptions made

### Documentation

Keep detailed records of:
- Which matching algorithms were used
- How many manual LinkedIn searches were conducted
- Confidence levels for manual determinations
- Any assumptions or edge cases

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- ✅ Match rate > 95% (under 15 unmatched)
- ✅ Confidence level documented for all matches
- ✅ Clear audit trail of manual research
- ✅ Updated retention survey for future analysis

**Quality Indicators**:
- Retention rates align with historical trends
- Institution-wise patterns make sense
- Manual research findings are well-documented

## 🔄 Future Prevention

To avoid similar issues in future years:

1. **Standardize data collection**:
   - Use consistent name formats
   - Validate email addresses at registration
   - Include unique identifiers when possible

2. **Regular data validation**:
   - Clean data immediately after collection
   - Run matching tests before final analysis

3. **Improve survey design**:
   - Include registration email in retention survey
   - Ask for alternative contact methods
   - Use unique member IDs if available

4. **Maintain contact**:
   - Regular check-ins with members
   - Update contact information proactively
